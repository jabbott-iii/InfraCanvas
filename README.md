## What is it?

You SSH into a server and start piecing things together: `docker ps`, `kubectl get pods`, `ss -tlnp`, `systemctl list-units`, `df -h`... ten commands later you still have no real picture of **what's running and how it all connects**.

InfraCanvas replaces that ritual with one binary you run yourself. It discovers every container, pod, service, volume and network, plus systemd services and processes on plain VMs, and serves a **live, interactive topology map** in your browser. Nodes are green when healthy, red when not. Open a terminal inside any container, tail logs, restart a service, or scale a deployment, all without leaving the page. Point it at [several VMs](#multiple-vms-one-dashboard) or [several clusters](#clusters-kubernetes-with-zero-install) and they all land in one dashboard.

You get a **map**, not a list: what runs where, what talks to what, and what's broken, at a glance. Self-hosted end to end: your infrastructure data never leaves your machines.

---

## Quick start

The same binary and the same install work either way, in a terminal or as a background service, on your laptop or on a VM. The only real choice is whether you want it to keep running after you close the terminal.

### Run it in a terminal

No VM, no systemd, no public URL, nothing to trust yet. Clone it, build it, run it on the machine you're already on:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bytestrix/InfraCanvas.git
cd InfraCanvas && make all
./bin/infracanvas serve --no-tunnel --private
# → http://localhost:7777/?token=…
```

Requires Go 1.21+ and Node.js 20+. Open the URL it prints. `--private` binds `127.0.0.1` only, `--no-tunnel` skips Cloudflare entirely; nothing leaves your machine.

- **Have Docker or a local Kubernetes context** (kind, minikube, Docker Desktop) on this machine? InfraCanvas auto-discovers local kubeconfig contexts (`$KUBECONFIG` or `~/.kube/config`) and connects to the current context at startup. To skip local kubeconfig auto-discovery, run `infracanvas serve --discover-local-kubeconfig=false` (or set `INFRACANVAS_DISCOVER_LOCAL_KUBECONFIG=false`).
- **Want to point it at a real cluster?** Click **+** next to **Clusters** in the sidebar and drop a kubeconfig. The dashboard talks to that cluster's API server directly, the same way `kubectl` does; the file is read into memory by this same local process and never transmitted anywhere. A picker appears if it has multiple contexts. [Full details](#clusters-kubernetes-with-zero-install), or expand below if you don't have a kubeconfig handy.

<details>
<summary>Don't have a kubeconfig handy?</summary>

If `kubectl` already works on this machine, you already have one: it's whatever `$KUBECONFIG` points to, or `~/.kube/config` by default:

```bash
cat ~/.kube/config
```

You can paste that whole file in. If it has clusters/contexts you don't want to hand over, trim it to just the one you're connecting first:

```bash
kubectl config view --minify --flatten > this-cluster-only.yaml
```

`--flatten` matters: it inlines any certs the file references by path, so the copy is self-contained.

No local kubeconfig yet? Generate one from your cloud provider, then drop that file in instead:

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <cluster> --region <region>          # EKS
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster> --zone <zone>     # GKE
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <rg> --name <cluster>         # AKS
```

One caveat: EKS/GKE/AKS-generated kubeconfigs typically authenticate via an `exec:` plugin (`aws`, `gcloud`, `az`) rather than an embedded token; that CLI needs to be installed and logged in on whichever machine runs `infracanvas serve`. This is automatically true if you're running it wherever `kubectl` already works for you, as above; it can bite you if you copy the file to a different machine that doesn't have that CLI.

</details>

Happy with what you see? This is already the whole install, nothing forces you to move it. Want it running after you close this terminal, or surviving a reboot? [Run it as a background service](#run-it-as-a-background-service) below.

### Run it as a background service

Same binary, same install, point it at a systemd unit instead of a terminal.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/bytestrix/InfraCanvas/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

**How you reach it afterward depends on where you just ran that:**

- **On a VM you'll open from somewhere else** (your laptop, anywhere): by default this opens a temporary Cloudflare tunnel, so you get a working HTTPS URL immediately, no domain or certs to set up first. That's why it's the default, most people putting this on a bare VM don't have a domain sitting ready. Don't want Cloudflare involved at all? Pass `--no-tunnel` to bind the port yourself and put [your own reverse proxy in front](#self-hosting-without-cloudflare), or `--private` to bind `127.0.0.1` only and reach it over an SSH tunnel instead, no public exposure either way.
- **On this same machine you're already on:** pass `--private --no-tunnel`. Nothing needs to leave this box, same idea as [Run it in a terminal](#run-it-in-a-terminal) above, just running in the background now instead of a terminal you'll eventually close.

It prints your URL and auth token on success:

```
✓ InfraCanvas installed and running

  Open in your browser:
    https://shy-pine-2f1a.trycloudflare.com/?token=a8f3e2b1c9d4f02e

  Auth token:  a8f3e2b1c9d4f02e  (saved in /etc/infracanvas/config.env)
```

**A Kubernetes cluster, no VM to run this on:** grab the binary and run it wherever `kubectl` already works for you (laptop, bastion, anywhere with network access to the cluster):

```bash
os=$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'); arch=$(uname -m); [ "$arch" = x86_64 ] && arch=amd64; [ "$arch" = aarch64 ] && arch=arm64
curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/bytestrix/InfraCanvas/releases/latest/download/infracanvas-$os-$arch"
chmod +x infracanvas-*
./infracanvas-* serve --no-tunnel --private
```

**Add more, once it's running:**

- **Another VM**: click **+ Add machine** in the sidebar; it hands you a ready-to-paste install command for that machine, join token included. [Details](#multiple-vms-one-dashboard)
- **Another cluster**: click **+** next to **Clusters** again, once per kubeconfig.
- **Don't want to run the dashboard yourself?** [InfraCanvas Cloud](https://cloud.infracanvas.app) does it for you: first 3 VMs free, no credit card.

<summary><strong>Other ways to install</strong></summary>

<br>

<details>
<summary><strong>Release binary: no installer, no systemd</strong></summary>

Grab a prebuilt binary from [Releases](https://github.com/bytestrix/InfraCanvas/releases/latest), make it executable, run it:

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/bytestrix/InfraCanvas/releases/latest/download/infracanvas-linux-amd64
chmod +x infracanvas-linux-amd64

./infracanvas-linux-amd64 serve --no-tunnel --private   # localhost only, SSH-tunnel in
./infracanvas-linux-amd64 serve --no-tunnel             # bind 0.0.0.0:7777, open the port yourself
```

Just a static binary you can delete when done, no firewall changes made on your behalf.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>One-liner install flags</strong></summary>

Every flag below works through the curl installer too ([read the script first](install-agent.sh), it's one file of plain bash):

```bash
# Skip Cloudflare tunnel; bind 0.0.0.0:7777 directly
curl -fsSL https://github.com/bytestrix/InfraCanvas/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s -- --no-tunnel

# Bind 127.0.0.1 only; reach via SSH tunnel (implies --no-tunnel)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/bytestrix/InfraCanvas/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s -- --private

# Custom port (default 7777), only matters with --no-tunnel
curl -fsSL https://github.com/bytestrix/InfraCanvas/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s -- --port 8888

# Read-only: viewers can look, not touch; public demos and dashboards on a TV
curl -fsSL https://github.com/bytestrix/InfraCanvas/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s -- --read-only

# Disable local kubeconfig auto-discovery (keeps Docker auto-discovery on)
INFRACANVAS_DISCOVER_LOCAL_KUBECONFIG=false infracanvas serve

# Agent-only: join this VM to an existing hub (see Multiple VMs below)

```

## Can I trust this on my VM?

You should ask that about anything you run on a production box. Here's the model, verifiable in this repo:

- **Your data never leaves your machines.** Discovery, the relay, and the dashboard all run in one process on your VM. There is no cloud backend, no account, no telemetry, no phone-home. The only outbound connection is the optional Cloudflare tunnel, and you can turn it off.
- **The tunnel is a convenience, not a requirement.** `--no-tunnel` binds a port you open yourself; `--private` binds `127.0.0.1` so the only way in is your own SSH. Zero third parties involved.
- **Everything is readable before you run it.** The [installer](install-agent.sh) is one file of plain bash. The whole product is AGPL-3.0: build it from source in two commands and run exactly what you compiled.
- **Auth by default.** Every install generates a random token; without it every request gets `401`. Secrets in env vars are [redacted](#security-model) before they ever reach the UI layer.
- **Runs as your user, not root**, with only the access you already have (docker group, your kubeconfig).

Full details in the [Security model](#security-model) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Multiple VMs, one dashboard

The mechanics behind the self-host path in [Quick start](#quick-start): one VM runs the dashboard (the **hub**); every other VM streams to it over an **outbound-only** WebSocket, no ports opened, nothing installed beyond the agent. The dashboard's **+ Add machine** button gives you the join command below pre-filled with the right host/token; this is what to run if you'd rather do it by hand.

```bash
# On the hub VM:
infracanvas serve      # prints a join token + ready-made join command

# On every other VM (copy the command serve printed):
curl -fsSL https://github.com/bytestrix/InfraCanvas/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
  | sudo bash -s -- --join <hub-url> --token <join-token>

# or, with the binary already there:
infracanvas start --backend <hub-url> --token <join-token>
```

Each machine appears in the sidebar's **Machines** list within seconds; click to switch between live canvases. Agents reconnect automatically and keep their identity across restarts.

Prefer fully isolated dashboards instead? Just install normally on each VM: every one gets its own URL.

---

## Clusters: Kubernetes with zero install

If you already run Kubernetes, you don't need to put an agent anywhere. Click **+** next to **Clusters** in the sidebar and drop a kubeconfig; the dashboard talks to your cluster's API server directly, the same way `kubectl` does, running from the same machine as `infracanvas serve`.

The kubeconfig **never leaves your machine**: it's read straight into memory by the same process serving your dashboard, saved locally at `0600` permissions next to your other InfraCanvas state, and never transmitted anywhere. If the cluster's API server is reachable from wherever `infracanvas serve` is running, this is the whole setup: no pod to deploy, no RBAC to review, no trust given to anything beyond your own kubeconfig's existing permissions.

A kubeconfig with several contexts shows a picker so you connect exactly the cluster(s) you mean to; nothing gets added silently. Add as many as you like; each shows up as its own entry under **Clusters**.

---

## Features

### Live topology map
Every container, pod, service, volume and network drawn as connected nodes with edges showing what talks to what. Not a list, a map. Updates every 30 seconds, diff-only.

Starts minimal, just the host. Click **•••** on any node to drill into what's inside it (Kubernetes → Deployments → a specific pod, for example), so a box running a full cluster doesn't dump hundreds of nodes on you at once.

### Works on any VM, even without Docker or Kubernetes
Plain VMs running nginx, postgres, node via systemd or PM2 get real workload nodes on the canvas. Listening ports and established connections are mapped from `/proc/net/tcp`, so you get real `CONNECTS_TO` edges (e.g. `next-server → postgres :5432`) without any config.

### LXC / LXD / Incus
Containers managed by LXD or Incus are auto-discovered from the local socket and drawn on the canvas alongside Docker and Kubernetes: name, status, memory, and network, no config. Interactive terminal sessions plus one-click start/stop/restart actions are also supported for these containers.

### Podman
Podman's daemon speaks the same API as Docker's, so the agent talks to it with no separate integration: if there's no Docker socket, it checks Podman's rootless socket (`/run/user/<uid>/podman/podman.sock`) and then the rootful one, in that order, before falling back to `DOCKER_HOST` if you've set it. Containers, images, volumes, and networks all show up the same way they would under Docker, and the runtime node on the canvas correctly labels itself "Podman" instead of "Docker."

### Terminals, logs and actions built in
- **Container terminal**: full interactive shell inside any container
- **VM shell**: host PTY, no SSH needed
- **Logs**: tail any container, pod, or systemd service with one click, color-coded
- **Actions**: restart, stop, start, scale, rolling-restart, update image, service start/stop, process kill, all from the node panel

### Health at a glance
Green / amber / red from real container state, pod phase, and zombie process detection. An alert banner appears automatically when something breaks.

### Inspect everything
Env vars (secrets auto-masked), port mappings, volume mounts, image details, service unit, main PID, restart count, established connections.

### Zero dependencies
One static Go binary with the dashboard embedded. Works with Docker, Kubernetes, plain systemd services, PM2, none of them required.

### Many VMs, one canvas
Run the dashboard on one VM and join the rest as outbound-only agents; no inbound ports on the joined machines. Switch between them from the sidebar. See [Multiple VMs](#multiple-vms-one-dashboard).

### Kubernetes clusters, no agent required
Drop a kubeconfig and see/control that cluster immediately: no install anywhere, kubeconfig never leaves your machine. See [Clusters](#clusters-kubernetes-with-zero-install).

### Secure by default
Binds localhost. Tunnel is optional and outbound-only. Random per-install auth token, separate token for joining agents. Secret redaction before data leaves the discovery layer. Runs as your user, not root. Optional `--read-only` mode for public dashboards.

---

## How it works

<p align="center"><img src="docs/architecture.png" alt="Architecture diagram: infracanvas serve runs the relay, dashboard, and discovery in one process; your browser reaches it directly or through an optional outbound-only Cloudflare tunnel; other VMs join as outbound agents; Kubernetes clusters connect directly via kubeconfig with no agent installed" width="820"></p>

One binary, one URL. The dashboard, relay and discovery agent all run in the same process on the machine you're inspecting. Your browser is just a client. The tunnel is optional; with `--no-tunnel` or `--private` it drops out entirely and nothing leaves your network.

Adding more VMs keeps the same shape: the hub's relay accepts extra agents, each connecting **outbound** to the hub; joined VMs open no inbound port and serve no UI, they only push their graph to the hub.

Kubernetes clusters connect a third way, with no agent at all: drop a kubeconfig and the hub talks to that cluster's API server directly, the same way `kubectl` does. See [Clusters](#clusters-kubernetes-with-zero-install).

---

## Self-hosting without Cloudflare

The default install uses a Cloudflare quick-tunnel for zero-config HTTPS. If you want to use your own domain and reverse proxy instead, pass `--no-tunnel`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/bytestrix/InfraCanvas/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s -- --no-tunnel
# Binds 0.0.0.0:7777, no cloudflared process started
```

Then point your reverse proxy at `127.0.0.1:7777`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Nginx + Let's Encrypt</strong></summary>

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name infra.yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name infra.yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/infra.yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/infra.yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7777;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_read_timeout 300s;
    }
}
```

Get a cert: `sudo certbot --nginx -d infra.yourdomain.com`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Caddy (auto-HTTPS, simplest option)</strong></summary>

```caddy
infra.yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:7777
}
```

Caddy handles TLS automatically. No certbot needed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>SSH tunnel (no domain needed)</strong></summary>

Keep the server private (`--private` binds `127.0.0.1` only), then forward to your laptop:

```bash
# On your laptop:
ssh -L 7777:127.0.0.1:7777 user@your-server
# Open: http://localhost:7777/?token=<your-token>
```

No public exposure, no domain, no TLS setup.

</details>

---

## Security model

**The exposed URL.** Default mode binds `127.0.0.1:7777` and exposes it through a Cloudflare quick-tunnel, outbound-only from your VM, HTTPS-terminated at Cloudflare's edge. Pass `--no-tunnel` to bind `0.0.0.0` directly, or `--private` to bind `127.0.0.1` only and reach it via SSH tunnel.

**The auth token.** Every install generates a random 24-character token saved to `/etc/infracanvas/config.env`. The dashboard requires it on first visit (`?token=…`); after that it's in an HTTP-only cookie. Without the token, every request returns `401`. Treat the URL+token like an SSH key for the box.

**Joining agents.** In hub mode the relay issues a separate join token; an agent that can't present it is rejected at the WebSocket handshake. Joined VMs connect outbound only; the hub never dials into them, so they need no open port. The join token alone doesn't prove *which* machine a connection is, though: each machine ID is issued its own resume secret on first connect, and a reconnect claiming that ID without it is rejected outright rather than silently taking over an existing session.

**Read-only mode.** Pass `--read-only` to turn the dashboard into a viewer: the relay rejects every action, terminal request, and cluster connect/disconnect server-side. Topology and logs still work. Use this for public demos or a wall-mounted status screen. Each connected cluster also has its own independent read-only toggle, so you can keep some clusters view-only without turning on global read-only mode.

**Permission preview.** Before you commit to connecting a kubeconfig, the Add Cluster dialog shows what it can actually do (view, exec, restart/kill, scale/edit, read Secrets), checked live against the cluster, nothing persisted or connected until you confirm.

**Audit log.** Every write action, terminal session, and read-only-blocked attempt is recorded locally and viewable from the dashboard's Audit tab. Attributed by machine, not by user; there's no per-user login in the self-hosted version.

**Secret redaction.** Env vars whose names contain `SECRET`, `TOKEN`, `KEY`, `PASSWORD`, `CREDENTIAL`, `AUTH`, or `PASSWD` are replaced with `[REDACTED]` before they leave the discovery layer.

**Runs as you, not root.** The systemd unit runs as `$SUDO_USER`. The agent inherits your `~/.kube/config` and docker group membership; no privilege escalation beyond what you already have.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the vulnerability disclosure policy.

## Managing the service

```bash
sudo systemctl status   infracanvas
sudo systemctl restart  infracanvas
sudo systemctl stop     infracanvas
sudo journalctl -u infracanvas -f
```

Config in `/etc/infracanvas/config.env`:

```bash
INFRACANVAS_UI_TOKEN=a8f3e2b1c9d4f02e
INFRACANVAS_PORT=7777
INFRACANVAS_TUNNEL=true
INFRACANVAS_PRIVATE=false
INFRACANVAS_READONLY=false
```

On a VM installed with `--join`, the same file instead holds the hub address and join token:

```bash
INFRACANVAS_BACKEND=https://hub.example.com
INFRACANVAS_TOKEN=<join-token>
```

Edit, then `sudo systemctl restart infracanvas`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Uninstall</strong></summary>

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/bytestrix/InfraCanvas/releases/latest/download/uninstall.sh | sudo bash
```

Removes: binary, systemd unit, `/etc/infracanvas/`, and the cached `cloudflared` binary (~30 MB). Or run locally: `sudo ./uninstall-agent.sh`
